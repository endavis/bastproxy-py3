"""Module for managing a simple queue with optional ID-based lookups.

This module provides the `SimpleQueue` class, which implements a basic queue
with a fixed length. It supports standard queue operations such as enqueue,
dequeue, and size retrieval. Additionally, it offers snapshot functionality
and ID-based item lookups if an ID key is provided during initialization.

Key Components:
    - SimpleQueue: A class that implements a simple queue with optional ID-based
        lookups.
    - Methods for enqueuing, dequeuing, and retrieving the size of the queue.
    - Snapshot functionality to capture the current state of the queue.
    - ID-based item lookup if an ID key is provided.

Features:
    - Fixed-length queue with automatic removal of oldest items when the queue is
        full.
    - Snapshot functionality to capture and retrieve the state of the queue at a
        point in time.
    - ID-based item lookup for quick access to specific items if an ID key is
        provided.
    - Methods to get the last X items and to check if the queue is empty.

Usage:
    - Instantiate SimpleQueue with an optional length and ID key.
    - Use `enqueue` to add items to the queue and `dequeue` to remove items.
    - Retrieve the size of the queue with `size` and check if it is empty with
        `isempty`.
    - Capture the current state of the queue with `takesnapshot` and retrieve it
        with `getsnapshot`.
    - Use `get` to get a copy of the current items and `get_last_x` to get the last
        X items.
    - Use `get_by_id` to retrieve an item by its ID if an ID key is provided.

Classes:
    - `SimpleQueue`: Represents a simple queue with optional ID-based lookups.
