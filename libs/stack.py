"""Module for managing a simple stack data structure.

This module provides the `SimpleStack` class, which implements a basic stack
with additional features such as snapshots and item lookup by ID. It includes
methods for standard stack operations like push, pop, and peek, as well as
utility methods for managing snapshots and retrieving items by ID.

Key Components:
    - SimpleStack: A class that implements a simple stack data structure.
    - Methods for pushing, popping, peeking, and removing items from the stack.
    - Utility methods for taking snapshots and retrieving items by ID.

Features:
    - Basic stack operations: push, pop, peek, and size.
    - Snapshot functionality to capture the current state of the stack.
    - ID-based item lookup for stacks with dictionary items.

Usage:
    - Instantiate SimpleStack to create a stack object.
    - Use `push` to add items to the stack and `pop` to remove items.
    - Use `takesnapshot` to capture the current state of the stack.
    - Retrieve items by ID using `get_by_id` if the stack items are dictionaries.

Classes:
    - `SimpleStack`: Represents a simple stack data structure with additional features.
