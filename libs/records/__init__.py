"""
This "package"" has classes for various record types and record managers
The public record types ones are:
    SendDataDirectlyToClient - send data to the client
    ProcessDataToClient - process data to send to the client
    NetworkData - build data to send
    LogRecord - data to log
    SendDataDirectlyToMud - send data to the mud
    ProcessDataToMud - process data to send to the mud
    EventArgsRecord - data to send to event callbacks

The public manager is RMANAGER, which manages records or all types

There are also some private classes that are used to manage records
    BaseRecord - the base class for all records
    ChangeRecord - a record that holds a change to a record
    ChangeManager - a manager that manages changes to records
