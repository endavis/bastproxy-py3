"""Module for tracking and managing callback functions.

This module provides the `Callback` class, which allows for the tracking and
management of callback functions. It includes methods for executing the callback,
checking equality, and generating a hash for the callback, making it a valuable
tool for managing event-driven programming.

Key Components:
    - Callback: A class that represents a callback function with tracking capabilities.

Features:
    - Automatic tracking of callback execution count and last execution time.
    - Equality checks between callback instances and functions.
    - Hash generation for callback instances.
    - String representation of callback instances.

Usage:
    - Instantiate `Callback` to create a callback object with a specific function.
    - Use the `execute` method to run the callback function.
    - Compare callback instances using equality operators.
    - Generate a hash for a callback instance using the `__hash__` method.

Classes:
    - `Callback`: Represents a class that tracks and manages callback functions.
