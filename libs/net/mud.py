"""Module for handling client connections to a MUD server.

This module provides the `MudConnection` class, which manages the connection
to a MUD server, including reading from and writing to the server, handling
telnet options, and managing the connection state.

Key Components:
    - MudConnection: A class that manages the connection to a MUD server.
    - Methods for connecting, disconnecting, reading, and writing to the MUD server.
    - Utility methods for handling telnet options and managing the connection state.

Features:
    - Asynchronous connection handling using asyncio.
    - Telnet option negotiation and handling.
    - Queue-based message sending to the MUD server.
    - Comprehensive logging of connection events and data transmission.

Usage:
    - Instantiate MudConnection with the server address and port.
    - Use `connect_to_mud` to establish the connection.
    - Use `disconnect_from_mud` to close the connection.
    - Use `send_to` to send data to the MUD server.
    - The `mud_read` and `mud_write` methods handle reading from and writing to the
        server.

Classes:
    - `MudConnection`: Manages the connection to a MUD server.
