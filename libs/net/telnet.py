"""Module for handling Telnet protocol operations and commands.

This module provides functions and constants for working with the Telnet protocol,
including building commands, handling sub-negotiations, and managing opcodes. It
includes utility functions for constructing Telnet commands, advertising features,
and handling opcodes received from a connected client.

Key Components:
    - Constants for Telnet protocol opcodes.
    - Utility functions for building and handling Telnet commands.
    - Functions for advertising features and managing Telnet options.

Features:
    - Construction of Telnet commands and sub-negotiation commands.
    - Handling and decoding of received Telnet opcodes.
    - Advertising game capabilities to connected clients.
    - Enabling and disabling Telnet echo mode.

Usage:
    - Use `iac` and `iac_sb` to build Telnet commands.
    - Use `split_opcode_from_input` to separate opcodes from input data.
    - Use `advertise_features` to build a byte string of features to advertise.
    - Use `handle` to decode and handle received Telnet opcodes.

Functions:
    - `iac`: Build Telnet commands on the fly.
    - `iac_sb`: Build Telnet sub-negotiation commands on the fly.
    - `split_opcode_from_input`: Separate opcodes from input data.
    - `advertise_features`: Build and return a byte string of features to advertise.
    - `echo_on`: Return the Telnet opcode for enabling echo.
    - `echo_off`: Return the Telnet opcode for disabling echo.
    - `go_ahead`: Return the Telnet opcode for "Go Ahead".
    - `handle`: Decode and handle received Telnet opcodes.
