"""Module for timing functions and managing timing operations.

This module provides the `Timing` class and `duration` decorator to measure and
manage the execution time of functions. It includes methods for starting and
finishing timers, toggling the timing functionality, and logging the timing
information using the provided API.

Key Components:
    - Timing: A class that manages timing operations.
    - duration: A decorator to measure the duration of function calls.

Features:
    - Start and finish timers with unique identifiers.
    - Toggle the timing functionality on and off.
    - Log timing information with detailed context.
    - Measure the duration of function calls using the `duration` decorator.

Usage:
    - Instantiate the `Timing` class to create a timing manager.
    - Use the `duration` decorator to measure the execution time of functions.
    - Start and finish timers using the `start` and `finish` methods.
    - Toggle the timing functionality using the `toggle` method.

Classes:
    - `Timing`: Manages timing operations and logs timing information.
