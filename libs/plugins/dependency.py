"""Module for resolving plugin dependencies in the bastproxy project.

This module provides the `PluginDependencyResolver` class, which is used to resolve
dependencies among plugins to ensure they are loaded in the correct order. It includes
methods for resolving dependencies and handling circular references, making it a
valuable tool for managing plugin relationships in the application.

Key Components:
    - PluginDependencyResolver: A class that resolves plugin dependencies.
    - Methods for resolving dependencies and handling circular references.

Features:
    - Automatic resolution of plugin dependencies.
    - Detection and handling of circular references.
    - Logging of errors when required plugins cannot be loaded.

Usage:
    - Instantiate PluginDependencyResolver with a list of plugins to resolve
        dependencies.
    - Use `resolve` method to start the dependency resolution process.
    - Access resolved and unresolved plugins through the class attributes.

Classes:
    - `PluginDependencyResolver`: Represents a class that resolves plugin dependencies.
