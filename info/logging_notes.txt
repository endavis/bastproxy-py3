Logging uses the standard python logging module.

see libs.logs, plugins.core.logs, and libs.records for the implementation

Brief Overview:
It removes all handlers from root and adds 3 new custom ones
    ConsoleHandler
    TimedRotatingFileHandler
    ClientHandler

Each of those handlers verifies with plugins.core.log whether the message
can be emitted by the handler at the specified level.
Messages that are LogRecords with multiple sources will only be emitted once
from the same handler. This is tracked with a dictionary in the LogRecord

It also adds a CustomColorFormatter to color code logs, the colors can be changed
with the core.plugins.log plugin

If the message is a LogRecord from libs.records, it is tracked through the system
to see modifications and can be inspected with plugins.core.log.record command

A LogRecord will pass all keyword arguments to the logger when the appropriate
level function is invoked.
