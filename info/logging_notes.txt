Logging uses the standard python logging module.

see libs.logs, plugins.core.logs, and libs.records for the implementation

Brief Overview:
It removes all handlers from root and adds 3 new custom ones
    ConsoleHandler
    TimedRotatingFileHandler
    ClientHandler

Each of those handlers verifies with plugins.core.log whether the message
can be emitted by the handler at the specified level.

It also adds a CustomColorFormatter to color code logs, the colors can be changed
with the core.plugins.log plugin

If the message is a LogRecord from libs.records, it is tracked through the system
to see modifications and can be inspected with plugins.core.log.record command
