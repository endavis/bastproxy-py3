# IN PROGRESS
    # BUG: fix reloading/loading - dependencies are broken
    # TODO: plugin.core.commands
        keep a global count vs instance count of called commands
            useful for when updating commands
        keep track of errors for each command
        create a plugin.core.commands.det to get command details
        make all output look the same for all commands
            toplevel header
            sub header
    # TODO: look at ENUM for flags?
    # TODO: create classes for specific items (mainly dicts) that are structured
        TODO: watches, triggers, plugin stats, etc.
        COMPLETE: events, commands
    # TODO: have a seperate line length for each client, use telnet negotiation
    # TODO : all plugin reloading
        reload entire proxy but keep connections open?
            save clients and mud connection
            unload all plugins
                clearing APis for that plugin
                clearing events
                remove all async tasks related to a plugin
                can we use importlib.reload?
            reload all modules except libs.net, libs.async, and mudproxy.py
        # Commands are kept in the plugin and then the command plugin can get them specific to api call for each plugin instead of them being stored in the command plugin
        # the idea
            attach to the plugin_loaded and plugin_unloaded event and update command list when seen
            how to be able to call the api for each plugin to get its commands?
        # could this be used for all plugins?, pull from source plugin vs push to action plugin (commands, triggers, etc)
        # and then plugins could be reloaded much easier
        # Plugins done: core.commands

        # add a function internal to the plugin to save it's state in a dictionary or copy it into the new instance?
        check refcounts to see what is still used
        # also need to think about classes that were used
            EG: commands has a Command class that is saved in another plugin's instance

        Reloading Single Plugins:
            OLD Thoughts:
                Reloading plugins (see above about commands plugin):
                    #NEW save data to the specific plugin, so command data goes into each plugin instead
                    #NEW of the command plugin, then the command plugin registers to the initialize and
                    #NEW and uninitialize events to update it's local caches, data, etc..
            NEW Thoughts:
                Decorate functions with info to recreate stuff
                The command plugin now uses decorators and so can easily rebuild the commands for a plugin
                    What about commands created at runtime like the reset command - put this in the event for that specific plugin initialization
                        see baseclass._commands
                Events does the same for registrations (not for event definitions)

        don't save plugin_instances in data structures inside a plugin unless absolutely needed
        if you need the instance, save the plugin_id and then use the api 'core.plugins:get:plugin:instance'
        saving instances could lead to a memory leak and stale plugin instances floating around

        create a "plugin" directory under the main plugin directory
            when a plugin is reloaded, everything in the directory is reloaded
        creata a "libs" directory under the main plugin directory
            when a plugin is reloaded, this directory is not reloaded

        do we just have reload and start from scratch but keep connections?

    # TODO: create other records for tracking things
        can we combine events and records to make things easier to track?
            records are used to track data
            events are used to track workflow
        create a record tree
            ToMudRecord
                    |-> EventRecord('ev_to_mud_data_modify')
                        |-> CommandRecord(command)
                            |-> ToClientRecord(command_output)
                    |-> EventRecord('ev_to_mud_data_read')
            ToClientRecord
                    |-> EventRecord('ev_to_client_data_modify')
                            |-> TriggerRecord()
                                |-> SubstitionRecord

        refactor to libs.tracking

            libs.tracking.data.LogRecord
            libs.tracking.workflow.event
                could track events, command, triggers, etc
        ???: records are for tracking data changes, should tracking flows
            be added?
        the event itself, commands, triggers, timers
        could add errors to the record
            for a command, the exception
            for an event, the function that errored with the exception

    # TODO: look at slots
        NOTES: This messes with using __dict__ to format strings

# DONE
    # COMPLETE: libs.api
        COMPLETE: add an api to add an event to core.events
        class should hold everything including args
        see libs.events and plugins.core.events:add:event
        COMPLETE: add stats cmd to apihelp for parents with a ':' in the name
        COMPLETE: make @api decorator to add api items
            see how commands are added with decorators
            I don't think this will work since APIs are added at runtime with instance methods
                and decorators are added at compile time
            args would be a name
            it would instrospect the function
                if it finds a plugin in the next stack up, it would add it through that plugin
            if not
                it would add it by the argument
            error checking to see if the function is not already in the api
        COMPLETE: change
                #BP:    setting.get                    - # get the value of a setting
                #BP:         - added in plugins.core.proxy  - called 24 time

    # COMPLETE: libs.records
        COMPLETE: keep up with the last (important) record created (ToClientRecord, ToMudRecord, EventArgsRecord, CmdArgsRecord, LogRecord)?
            keep up with it in RecordManager and add related records before it changes?
        COMPLETE: change record addchange to addupdate, refactor to update

        COMPLETE: instead of passing around event_args
            created two apis: plugins.core.events:get:current:event:name
                            plugins.core.events:get:current:event:record
        COMPLETE: add all events to a timeline
            or create an api to start tracking all events and stop tracking all events
            see variable all_event_stack in events plugin
    # COMPLETE: plugins.core.pluginm
        COMPLETE: in pluginm.list make required plugins blue
        COMPLETE: move plugin manager to a separate file and out of plugins/__init__.py
        COMPLETE: Combine PluginPackageInfo and LoadedPluginInfo
            add short_name to PluginPackageInfo
            PluginPackageInfo can have a
                "Active Plugin" item that contains
                    the module, the plugin instance, imported_time, isimported, isinitialized

            need only 3
                plugin_init_file_path - points to __init__.py
                plugin_package_path - points to package directory
                full_import_location - used for importing (equivalent to plugin_id in current implementation)
        COMPLETE: move plugin loading/import/instantiation/initializing machinery into libs
            only have apis, commands, event cb, etc in the plugin itself
        COMPLETE: check if self.auto_initialize_f = False is needed now that plugin initialization
            has changed

    # COMPLETE: plugins.core.commands
        COMPLETE: change execute to only send to the client that executed the command if internal
        COMPLETE: decorator for adding commands
            see libs/commands.py
            the decorator includes the various info as attributes on the function
            the command plugin looks for any functions that start with _command_ in the instance and
                any instance attributes (1 level down)
        COMPLETE: create an api in commands to remove .plugins from a command string
            see : plugins.core.commands:get.command.format
            or an api for get command string(plugin_id, command)

                4/3/2023 - Decided Yes :) could change.

            New Timer:
                figure out the first time it should fire and add it to an instance attribute (self.next_fire_time)
                the execute function would look something like this
                    while self.enabled:
                        await asyncio.sleep(self.next_fire_time - now)

                        # run the function associated with the timer

            Need to figure out how to search this without looking for a Plugin object in all files
            maybe in __init__, put the standard plugin header files
            don't search for .py files, but search for packages?
        will need to change the way info.isvalidpythoncode = True works
        # NOTE: reloading plugins does not update any objects that have been imported by another plugin,
            try to keep imports into other plugins at a minimum
                one such item is a decorator that is used by other plugins, if the module the decorator exists in is reloaded
                then all the other modules that have used that decorator will have the old decorator and they will have references
                to the old module, meaning the old module will never be garbage collected until all those other modules have been reloaded.
