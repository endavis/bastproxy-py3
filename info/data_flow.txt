Data Flow - To Mud
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Proxy receives the data from the client or it is generated internally
2) The data is transformed to a ToMudData instance and is sent to the client data handler
    by calling the record
3) For each line that is not internal and not a telnet command:
    ToMudData raises the event 'ev_to_mud_data_modify'
     - Use this event to transform data received from the client
            use the DataLine object in the 'line' key
4) Proxy then sends the resulting message to the mud by queuing each line
5) After all data is sent, ToMudData will raise "ev_to_mud_data_read" event on data
    that is not a telnet command
       - Use this event if you only need to see the data sent to the mud,
           the data cannot be transformed through this event

Data Flow - To Client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Proxy receives the data from the mud or it is generated internally
2) The data is transformed to a ToClientData instance and is sent to the mud data handler
    by calling the record
3) For each line that is not internal and not a telnet command:
    ToClientData raises the event 'ev_to_client_data_modify'
     - Use this event to transform data received from the mud
            use the DataLine object in the 'line' key
4) Proxy then sends the resulting message to the client by queuing each line
5) After all data is sent, ToClientData will raise "ev_to_client_data_read" event on data
    that is not a telnet command
       - Use this event if you only need to see the data sent to the client,
           the data cannot be transformed through this event
NOTE: no events are raised for data sent to the client that originated in the proxy

Sending data to the mud
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) use a ToMudData instance and send by calling the record

Sending data to clients, this will also send it through the interpreter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  use a ToClientData instance and send by calling the record
